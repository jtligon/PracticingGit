This is a list of the five best recipes of all time:

#Blue Ribbon Cheesecake#
**Total Time**: 4 hours  **Kitchen Time**: 20 min 

**Makes:** enough for 8 people with excellent self-control

###Ingredients###
- 2 ten ounce packages Cream Cheese (light or regular, I don't notice a difference)
- 2 eggs
- Pie Crust (Chocolate is preferred)
- 3/4 cup Peanut butter (or to taste)
- Small Reese's cups, enough to crumble up (I like 1/2 package)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar

First, combine sugar, eggs and cream cheese using an electric mixer.  Mix until smooth.

Pour a little of this mixture into the bottom of the pie crust, and set pie crust in freezer.

Add peanut butter to remaining mixture and mix.  You'll notice the mixture is tougher than before.  Add a splash of milk if it gets too tough to work.

Add peanut butter mixture to pie crust and smooth out.

Bake at 325 for 40 minutes.  Refigerate for 3 hours.  Sprinkle crushed Reese's on top.

###Variations###
Nutella-Raspberry cheesecake is delicious.  Blend 1/4 cup Nutella and 1/4 cup baspberries in instead of peanut butter.  Then, make streaks of Nutella in the cake before baking.  Top with fresh raspberries after cooling.

#Broccoli Good Enough You'll Actually Eat it#
**Total Time**: 25 min  **Kitchen Time**: 10 min

**Makes:** 2-4 servings, depending on broccoli

###Ingredients###
- 1 head broccoli
- 1/3 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 2 tsp Garlic
- Parmesan Cheese

Cut broccoli (BUT DO NOT RINSE) and put in a baking pan lined with aluminum foil.  
Cover with oil and garlic.  Lift up the foil to aid in spreading everything evenly.

Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Sprinkle with Parmesan, then bake for 3-5 more minutes until the
broccoli starts to go brown/black on the edges.  Repeat, when it **starts** to go black on the tips.  Not "is fully blackened".

This same thing works wonderfully with asparagus.
